## Git Commit Message Best Practice

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Submitting Pull Requests

Please always submit PRs to the Staging branch, never to Master.

Please ensure that you have submitted an issue so that you can reference and close it in your PR.

Features will be moved to master once they have been adequately tested in Staging.
